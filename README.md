In this repository we show the code for the Automatic differentiated Physics-Informed Echo State Network (API-ESN) by A.Racca and L.Magri published in Lecture Notes for Computer Science (2021). A preprint can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00002.

For more details on how the code works, there is an additional README file inside the source folder.
